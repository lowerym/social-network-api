# Social Network API

## Description
The following is an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, create reactions to said thoughts, add friends, and create a friends list. The application uses a combination of Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Moongoose ODM. For the date, I used the native Javascript Date object.
